Adds a few new buttons to the Social page to make VRChat a better game.


New features:
 - Adds a button that opens a user in the Quick Menu from the Social Menu page
 - Adds a button that allows you to get the avatars author from the Social Menu page
 - Adds a button that shows you the bio of the selected user (bio is different from status)
Note: This needs UIExpansionKit (https://github.com/knah/VRCMods#uiexpansionkit)

Also, credits to Ben (https://github.com/BenjaminZehowlt) because I referenced his code a lot to impliment Xref Scanning
